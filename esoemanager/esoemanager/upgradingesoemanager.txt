This document is for users upgrading from the previous version of ESOE Manager. 
You can tell if you have the older version of ESOE Manager as it has links for wiki and the issue tracker in 
the bottom right hand corner of pages, the new version does now.

Firstly you will require the new esoemanager.war, this has the same set of dependencies as the previous version
with regards to Tomcat shared and common libraries.

Shutdown your current ESOE Manager instance and remove the war and exploded directory.

ESOE Startup now creates an extra table and some extra restrictions for a table called DESCRIPTOR_NAMEID_FORMATS. Be sure to manually execute this
table and key creation logic in your database prior to restarting, there is no need to populate content. It also creates an extra column in ENTITY_DESCRIPTORS
called ENTITYHOST. There is no need to populate this data, however if you run load balanced services you should use ESOE Manager to set a "Serivce Host" on the
"nodes" tab per service.

For ORACLE users specifically you need to tune cache sizes of sequences. Previously this was set as 20 or 10, this should be lowered to 2.

Two columns have also been added to DESCRIPTOR_PUBLIC_KEYS; ISSUERDN and SERIALNUMBER. These do not need to be populated when upgrading, but must be created in the table.

The following config options are now deprecated for esoemanager.config and should be removed:

## Service Defaults
# Java Powered Services
# Assertion Consumer Service Endpoint
java.defaultACS=/spep/sso
# Single Logout Service Endpoint
java.defaultSLS=/spep/services/spep/singleLogout

The following config options have been added (generally these replace the above in a less verbose fashion)
databaseType= [mysql | oracle]  (choose value for your platform)

## Service Defaults
# Assertion Consumer Service Endpoint
defaultACS=/spep/sso
# Single Logout Service Endpoint
defaultSLS=/spep/services/spep/singleLogout
# Cache Clear Service Endpoint
defaultCCS=/spep/services/spep/authzCacheClear

sqlmap.config=WEB-INF/${databaseType}SqlMapConfig.xml

The new ESOE Manager performs authorization and UI modifications to fine grained levels. To ensure your able to access the system to start handing out
privileges ensure that for the ESOE Manager EntID/DescID combination you create a policy similar to the example "sample-superuser-policy.xml" available from
SVN for this project.

To subsequently give users admin rights over services you can use the new interface to create a new policy in the ESOE Manager service 
(this is important all admin access to services is granted from a policy stored in ESOE Manager) that looks similar to sample-serviceadmin-policy.xml available from
SVN for this project. Note ...serviceid:X refers to the value of EntID in the database for all services. New service creations have a policy created in ESOE Manager
automatically which superusers can then modify.

Once the above is undertaken you should be able to restart with the new ESOE Manager instance.
