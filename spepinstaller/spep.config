# Address of the service host in use without any application path

# Specify cookies to clear when am authentication session is destroyed
# Strings are of the format: cookie_name [space] cookie_domain (optional) [space] cookie_path (optional)
# For example:
#logoutClearCookie=MYAPP_SESSION example.com /myapp

# Port for the SPEP daemon to listen on.

# Attribute renaming. Changes the name of an attribute as set by ESOE.
#
# This is generally used to support legacy apps that expect attributes to be pushed into
# the web environment with specific names. 
#
# The rename parameter syntax is space separated such as:
#attributeRename=OriginalName NewName
#
# For example:
#attributeRename=uid username
# This example renames the attribute called "uid" to "username" (without quotes)

# Username attribute - the username to tell the web server is logged in.
# as an example - in Apache, this is mapped to REMOTE_USER
# Attribute renames are applied BEFORE this, so you will need to use the "new name"
# of the attribute if you have renamed it.
usernameAttribute=uid

# Prefix to add to attribute names before inserting into the web environment.
attributeNamePrefix=SPEP_ATTR_
attributeValueSeparator=|

# CA Bundle file to be used by cURL. For a proper installation of cURL on a Unix-like
# platform, this often will not need to be set. However if you need to customise your
# CA Bundle (for example, if your ESOE is using a self-signed certificate, or one 
# signed by an internal CA) this parameter will be useful.
caBundle=c:\Program Files\SPEP\Config\ca-bundle.crt

# This is only populated when SPEP is acting in a lazy mode, regex patterns may be applied here
# Extreme caution to carefully validate your web application access requirements is recommended with

# Values here should contain the path and query string of your application, 
# eg for https://myspep.company.org/myapp you would enter /myapp/secure.php.* to match any request for
